# SuperKart Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning (Python)

## Project Overview
This project replicates and extends a published retail sales forecasting study using the SuperKart dataset.  
The work is conducted as part of the *Programming for Data Science (Python)* coursework for the MSc Big Data Analytics program.

The implementation follows the methodology presented in an academic paper and applies Python-based machine learning techniques to predict product-level sales.

## Original Study Acknowledgement
This project is **based on and inspired by** the following published research:

**Venkiteela, P. (2025).**  
*Machine Learning Framework for Retail Sales Forecasting.*  
International Journal of Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering (IJCESEN).  
DOI: https://doi.org/10.22399/ijcesen.3993  

All conceptual ideas, problem framing, and baseline modeling approach originate from the above study.  
This repository is an **independent academic replication and learning exercise**, implemented for educational purposes only.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – SuperKart Retail Dataset  
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yemiadelaiye/superkart-dataset
- **Records:** 8,763 product–store observations
- **Features:** Structured product and store attributes
- **Target Variable:** `Product_Store_Sales_Total`

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature encoding and scaling  
5. Train–test split (70% / 30%)  
6. Regression modeling (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
7. Model evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE  

## Reproducibility
All datasets, Python scripts, outputs, and visualizations are included in this repository.  
Any researcher or student can reproduce the results by running the provided Jupyter Notebook in a standard Python environment.
